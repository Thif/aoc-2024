# Advent of code 2024

### Getting started

This repo is using poetry to set up a virtual environment 

```
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

### Run code for a given day ( on test data )

make sure the data is located in the input folder, for day 2
To run the code on actual input, it should be pasted and the path specified instead of the test folder path

```
poetry run python -m run_code day_2 ./test_inputs
```
